My name is An. Nguyen Hoai An. I'm currently living in Ho Chi Minh City Viet Nam.

Overall, I have 5 years of experience in this industry.
I am currently working at Global Fashion Group as a senior software engineer in the seller center service team.
In the previous company, I used to be a software engineer and a technical architect.

I'm skilled in backend development, distributed systems, microservices, Cloud.
I'm also familiar with modern software development methods like Scrum.

### What is your most proud project?

We have designed and implemented the multi-tenancy architect successfully in the product. 
We made it a common library so we were able to apply it in many services. 
It's a very important part of our system to keep data between tenants isolated.

Then 1 year ago, we enhanced it again. This time, we had to apply database sharding. As we did a good job in the beginning we completed it quickly. 
It was also an important move of our system, we had to remove the bottleneck in the database layer, we were able to serve much more customers.

### Strengths?
I'm curious about things. We often think about how Facebook, youtube, or Uber works. What they did to be able to serve so many users. 
I think it's a good point and It keeps me moving in this industry.
At work, I'm proactive. I think of how we can get the thing done and I will find fasted way to compelete it.

### Weakness?
I'm improving on how I convince others better. I have good ideas in my mind but I should make others understand and agree with me.
I'm interested in new things. I prefer to work on new features.
I'm not productive when doing many different things at a time.

### Have you ever driven any initiatives by yourself in the team?

- We store images in the database. Those images will then be displayed in the browser.
The team would like to cache images in the browser but they face the problem of cache invalidation. 
I told them for static content like images, let's make the API immutable, so we can solve the cache invalidation issue.

- Once we enhanced the product service. We added many more attributes to the product entity. 
The team mindset at that time was to have only 1 model per entity so when the model is used for different purposes it became complicated and dirty.
I predicted it and told the team that we could not implement this service the old way. Then we split it into 2 smaller parts, product-management and product-view, and used different models for them.
It works perfectly. After some time, I knew this kind of pattern is CQRS.

### Can you give me an example of a time how do you deal with a disagreement or conflict?
- When we enhance the product service. I was responsible to design the Entity Relationship Diagram of the service. 
It's relationship is complex where we would many table, artibutes and foreign keys. I proposed the team to remove some relationship, foreign key and custom it a little. 
It would be easier to develop and better for performance. The team did not agree, they said we should follow relationship strictly so we can avoid some bugs. 
I tried to convince them but I could not. At that time I think the team was scared to apply a new way, then I bring the problem to higher level CTO. 
And he said both solution were good and have pros and cons but let choose the one the team familiar with.

- Once I finished a feature and send PR to my teammates. There was a developer who kept asking me to change my code. 
But I thought it was not necessary to change it. I explained to him why I ended up with the solution but he did not agree. 
I felt uncomfortable because of a long discussion for a very small point. Then I bring the problem to the team. Both solution were good and the author could decide to keep the current one of change.
In the retrospective, we re-opened the point and discuss what should we do If we face the situation again. And we agree that we should not make long discussion in PR because It might create tension.
If 2 developer can not make the aggrement, the team will decide what to do.
